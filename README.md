This is a web application I created for my local church band to help us communicate. It is a nice web wrapper around bramka.gsmservice.pl bulk SMS sending service.

The app does not use any i18n library - all texts are in Polish. I would definitely use one in any serious project, though :)

Stack:
* Grails, Gradle, Docker, external API
* React+Redux, Bootstrap, Axios
